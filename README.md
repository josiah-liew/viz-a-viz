<h1>Viz-a-viz</h1>

A journal of my data visualization journey. As part of my work, I do a lot of visualizations for metagenomic/biological data. 

I would like to develop a **tidytuesday** habit and to also learn some D3.js. I will post my practice files (and resources I have found helpful) to this repository.
